Using this add-on, spoken text containing emoticon characters will be replaced by its more human friendly description.
86 emoticons are defined.

For example: ":)" will be spoken as "smiling smiley", or ":D" will be spoken as "laughing smiley"

You can take advantage of the following features:

## Insert Smiley ##

When you are unsure of the characters for a particular smiley, this feature enables you to select and insert it into your text such as in a chat.
Press **NVDA+I**, or from the **NVDA** menu, choose **Preferences -> Manage Emoticons -> Insert Smiley**, to open a dialog 
with the provided smilies. Choose a smily and pres **OK** to copy the correct characters to your clipboard, ready for pasting.

## Customize Emoticons ##

From the **NVDA** MENU, choose **Preferences -> Manage emoticons -> Customize Emoticons**. You can use this dialog to add or to edit available emoticons.
This dialog allows you to save an emoticons speech dictionary with your customizations.

Press **Save and Export Dictionary** to save a file named emoticons.dic in your user config folder, speechDicts subfolder.
